This paper presents a novel framework integrating YOLO11 and Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) for detecting and tracking small objects in traffic surveillance systems. The proposed approach leverages the YOLO11 architecture for object detection, followed by DGNN for efficient tracking by dynamically constructing and updating graph structures. The YOLO11 model extracts spatial features of small objects in video streams, while the DGNN processes these features to track objects effectively in real-time. The framework introduces dynamic graph creation with nodes representing object features and edges capturing interactions between them. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to achieve robust detection and tracking of small objects under varying traffic conditions, outperforming conventional methods in handling complex and dynamic environments. This research contributes to advancing intelligent transportation systems by providing a scalable and effective solution for real-time traffic surveillance and analysis.
